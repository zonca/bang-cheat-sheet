## Playing Cards
### Blue Cards (stay in play)

- **Barrel**: allows you to Draw! when hit by a Bang! card. If you draw a heart card,
counts as a Mancato!. Otherwise nothing happens.
A Mancato! card may still be played afterwards.
- ***Draw!*** action: flip over the top card from the deck, look at the poker symbol,
apply effect if appropriate, and discard it.
- **Dynamite**: **play this card in front of you** and wait a whole turn.
Then Draw!, if dynamites explodes you lose 3 life points and discard the card.
Otherwise pass the card along. Dynamite stays in play until explodes or is
discarded by a Panic! or Cat Balou.
- **Jail**: play this card in from of any player regardless of distance.
If you are in jail, Draw! before the start of your turn.
If you draw a heart card, you escape jail and proceed with your turn.
Otherwise, your turn is skipped and discard the card.
**Jail cannot be played on the Sheriff**.
- **Mustang**: other players see you at a distance +1.
- **Scope**: you see other players at distance -1.
- **Volcanic (weapon)**: play any number of Bang! cards during you turn.

### Brown Cards (discarded after use)

- **Bang!**: player hit loses 1 life point.
Take into account distance of player and reach of your weapon.
- **Beer**: regain 1 life point.
Life points cannot exceed your starting amount (determined by character).
May be played out of turn only immediately after receiving a lethal hit.
No effect when only 2 players remain.

to discard a card.
You may choose a **card in play in from of them** or pick **a random card from the hand**.

Starting with the challenged player, each may discard a Bang! until a player doesn't.
That player loses 1 life point. Missed! and Barrel have no effect. Not considered a Bang! card.
